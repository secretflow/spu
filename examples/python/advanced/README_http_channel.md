# HttpChannel Design and Implementation

## Overview

HttpChannel is a custom channel implementation for SPU that uses HTTP/HTTPS as the transport protocol instead of the default gRPC implementation. This design provides flexibility for environments where HTTP-based communication is preferred or required.

## Design Goals

- **HTTP-based Communication**: Use standard HTTP/HTTPS protocols for data transmission
- **Reliability**: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Performance**: Support connection pooling and parallel operations
- **Security**: Support SSL/TLS encryption and certificate verification
- **Compatibility**: Full integration with existing SPU link infrastructure

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **HttpChannelConfig**: Configuration class for channel parameters
2. **HttpChannel**: Main channel implementation inheriting from `link.IChannel`
3. **HTTP Session Management**: Persistent connection pooling with retry logic
4. **Message Protocol**: Custom HTTP endpoints for send/receive operations

### HTTP Endpoints

The HttpChannel uses the following REST endpoints:

- `POST /send_async/{key}` - Send data asynchronously
- `POST /send/{key}` - Send data synchronously
- `GET /recv/{key}` - Receive data for a specific key

### Configuration Options

```python
config = HttpChannelConfig(
    peer_url="http://localhost:8080",      # Peer URL
    timeout_ms=30000,                      # Request timeout
    max_retry=3,                           # Maximum retry attempts
    retry_interval_ms=1000,                # Base retry interval
    http_max_payload_size=32*1024*1024,    # Maximum payload size (32MB)
    enable_ssl=False,                      # Enable SSL/TLS
    ssl_verify=True,                       # Verify SSL certificates
    connection_pool_size=10                # HTTP connection pool size
)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Connection Management

- **Persistent Connections**: Uses HTTP connection pooling for efficiency
- **Automatic Retry**: Implements exponential backoff retry mechanism
- **Connection Health**: Monitors and maintains healthy connections

### 2. Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Handles connection failures, timeouts, and DNS issues
- **HTTP Errors**: Proper handling of 4xx and 5xx status codes
- **Data Integrity**: Validates payload sizes and data consistency

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Operations**: Supports concurrent send/receive operations
- **Throttling**: Configurable throttling window for flow control
- **Chunked Transfers**: Handles large payloads efficiently

### 4. Security Features

- **SSL/TLS Support**: Full HTTPS support with certificate verification
- **Configurable Verification**: Optional SSL certificate verification
- **Secure Headers**: Proper HTTP security headers

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
import spu.libspu.link as link
from custom_link import HttpChannel, HttpChannelConfig

# Configure HttpChannel
config = HttpChannelConfig(
    peer_url="http://peer.example.com:8080",
    timeout_ms=30000
)

# Create channel
channel = HttpChannel(config)

# Send data
channel.Send("my_key", b"Hello, SPU!")

# Receive data
data = channel.Recv("my_key")
print(f"Received: {bytes(data)}")
```

### Integration with SPU Link

```python
# Create multiple channels for a multi-party computation
channels = []
for peer_url in peer_urls:
    config = HttpChannelConfig(peer_url=peer_url)
    channels.append(HttpChannel(config))

# Create SPU link context
desc = link.Desc()
desc.id = "my_computation"
for i, party in enumerate(parties):
    desc.add_party(f"party_{i}", party['host'])

# Create context with custom channels
lctx = link.create_with_channels(desc, self_rank, channels)
```

### Secure Communication

```python
# Configure SSL/TLS
config = HttpChannelConfig(
    peer_url="https://secure.peer.com:8443",
    enable_ssl=True,
    ssl_verify=True,  # Verify server certificates
    timeout_ms=30000
)

channel = HttpChannel(config)
```

## Error Handling

The HttpChannel implements comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    channel.Send("key", data)
except RuntimeError as e:
    # Handle network or HTTP errors
    logger.error(f"Send failed: {e}")
except TimeoutError as e:
    # Handle timeout errors
    logger.error(f"Operation timed out: {e}")
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle data validation errors
    logger.error(f"Invalid data: {e}")
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_http_channel.py
```

Run the demo examples:

```bash
python http_channel_demo.py
```

## Performance Considerations

### Network Overhead

- HTTP has higher overhead than gRPC for small messages
- Consider message batching for high-frequency operations
- Use connection pooling to reduce connection establishment overhead

### Latency

- HTTP request-response pattern introduces latency
- Consider async operations for better throughput
- Tune timeout and retry parameters based on network conditions

### Throughput

- Parallel send operations can improve throughput
- Large payloads may benefit from compression
- Monitor connection pool utilization

## Security Considerations

### Transport Security

- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper certificate management
- Consider mutual TLS for enhanced security

### Message Integrity

- Implement message authentication if needed
- Consider payload encryption for sensitive data
- Validate message sizes and formats

### Access Control

- Implement proper authentication for HTTP endpoints
- Use network-level access controls
- Monitor and log all communication

## Limitations

1. **HTTP Protocol**: Higher overhead compared to binary protocols like gRPC
2. **Stateless Nature**: Each request is independent (can be mitigated with sessions)
3. **Error Recovery**: Limited built-in error recovery compared to gRPC
4. **Streaming**: HTTP/1.1 has limited streaming capabilities

## Future Enhancements

1. **HTTP/2 Support**: Implement HTTP/2 for better performance
2. **Compression**: Add payload compression for large messages
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience
4. **Metrics**: Add comprehensive performance metrics
5. **Load Balancing**: Support for load-balanced endpoints

## Comparison with Default Channels

| Feature | HttpChannel | GrpcChannel (Default) |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Protocol | HTTP/HTTPS | gRPC |
| Performance | Moderate | High |
| Security | SSL/TLS | TLS + Authentication |
| Configuration | Flexible | Standard |
| Firewall Friendly | Yes | Sometimes |
| Streaming | Limited | Full |
| Error Handling | Custom | Built-in |

## Conclusion

HttpChannel provides a flexible, HTTP-based alternative to the default gRPC channels in SPU. While it may have some performance trade-offs, it offers advantages in terms of deployment flexibility, firewall compatibility, and operational simplicity. The design prioritizes reliability, security, and ease of use while maintaining full compatibility with the SPU ecosystem.
