# How to dump IR to DAG in SPU

In this directory, we provide an example of how to dump the IR (Intermediate Representation, generated by [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/architecture))
of executed code to a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that illistrates the computation graph.

Please refer to [spu.proto](../../../libspu/spu.proto) for more descriptions of the compiler options for dumping IR.

1. Launch SPU backend runtime

    ``` shell
    bazel run -c opt //examples/python/utils:nodectl -- up
    ```

2. Run `ir_dump` example

    ``` shell
    bazel run -c opt //examples/python/ir_dump:ir_dump
    ```
