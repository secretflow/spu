# Algorithm Support lists

The table below shows the capabilities currently available in SML.
In general, the following features are rarely (partly) supported in SML:

- **Early stop** for training or iterating algorithm: We do not want to reveal any intermediate information.
- Manual set of **random seed**: SPU can't handle randomness of float properly, so if random value (matrix) is needed,
  user should pass it as a parameter (such as `rsvd`, `NMF`)
- **Data inspection** like counting the number of label, re-transforming the data or label won't be done.
  (So we may assume a "fixed" format for input or just tell the number of classes as a parameter)
- **single-sample SGD** not implemented for the latency consideration, MiniBatch-SGD (which we just call it `sgd` in
  sml) will replace it.
- Jax's Ops like `eigh`, `svd` can't run in SPU directly: `svd` implemented now is expensive and can't handle matrix
  that is not column full-rank matrix.
