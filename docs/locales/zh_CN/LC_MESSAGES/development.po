"This document is mainly for developers who want to add custom MPC "

"developers have a basic understanding of the SPU system architecture "
"(i.e., :ref:`/development/compiler.rst`, "
":ref:`/development/type_system.rst` and :ref:`/development/runtime.rst`) "
"and the `layout "
"<https://github.com/secretflow/spu/blob/main/REPO_LAYOUT.md>`_ of the SPU"
" code repository. In short, SPU translates the high-level applications "
"(such as machine learning model training) written in JAX to an MPC-"
"specific intermediate representation named PPHLO and then dispatches "
"PPHLO operations to the low-level MPC protocols. In theory, protocol "
"developers only need to implement a basic set of MPC operation APIs to "
"fully use the SPU infrastructure to run machine learning or data analysis"
" programs. That is to say, for most MPC protocol development, it only "
"needs to add some source code files into the libspu/mpc folder. At "
"present, SPU has integrated several protocols such as ABY3 and Cheetah, "
"which can be regarded as a guide for protocol implementation."
