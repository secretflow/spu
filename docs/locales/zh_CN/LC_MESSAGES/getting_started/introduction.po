"SPU (Secure Processing Unit) is a domain-specific **compiler and runtime "
"suite**, that aims to provide a **secure computation** service with "
"**provable security**."

"SPU compiler uses `XLA "
"<https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/operation_semantics>`_ as its front-end "
"Intermediate Representation (IR), therefore, SPU supports the XLA IR "
"outputs from Tensorflow, Jax, or PyTorch. Internally, the SPU compiler "
"compiles XLA to an MPC specific MLIR dialect which is later interpreted "
"by SPU runtime. Currently, SPU team highly recommends using `JAX "
"<https://github.com/google/jax>`_ and its sibling - `Flax "
"<https://github.com/google/flax>`_."

"SPU runtime implements various `MPC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki"
"/Secure_multi-party_computation>`_ protocols (as the back-end) to provide"
" **provable security**. SPU runtime is designed to be **highly "
"extensible**, protocol developers can hack into MPC protocols with "
"minimum effort and let the SPU compiler/runtime translate and interpret "
"complicated frontend logic on it."
