"SPU(Secure Processing Unit) consists of a frontend **compiler** and a "
"backend **runtime**. The frontend compiler accepts an ML program as input"
" and converts it into an **MPC-specific intermediate representation**. "
"After a series of delicate code optimizations, programs will be executed "
"by a performant backend runtime as MPC protocols. Based on SPU, we can "
"run ML programs of different frameworks with minor modifications in a "
"privacy-preserving manner."
