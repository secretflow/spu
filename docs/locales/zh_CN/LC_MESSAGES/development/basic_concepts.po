"In SPU, the first notable difference is that, *input* is not provided by a "

"provided by a separate party, finally, the output could be received by "
"another party. So **SPU is born to be used in a distributed context**. It "

"SPU 的显著特征在于：输入数据来源于多方，代码可能由独立参与方提供，计算结果亦"

"If we take a closer look, SPU itself is not a physical machine, it is hosted "

"**virtual machine**."
