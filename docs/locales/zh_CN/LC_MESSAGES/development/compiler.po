"The SPU compiler aims to provide first-party compiler support from the "
"different ML frameworks to SPU runtime."

"`MLIR <https://mlir.llvm.org/>`_ The MLIR project is a novel approach to "
"building reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure. MLIR aims to "
"address software fragmentation, improve compilation for heterogeneous "
"hardware, significantly reduce the cost of building domain specific "
"compilers, and aid in connecting existing compilers together."

"`XLA <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/architecture>`_ Multiple Vendors use"
" XLA as the middle layer, mapping from platform frameworks like PyTorch, "
"JAX, and TensorFlow into XLA and then progressively lowering down to "
"their target hardware."
msgstr "XLA：多家供应商使用 XLA 作为中间层，从 PyTorch、JAX 和 TensorFlow 等平台框架映射到 XLA，然后逐步翻译到目标硬件。"

msgid ""
"Having canonical lowerings from different frontend frameworks to the MLIR"
" ecosystem would provide much needed relief to hardware vendors to focus "
"on their unique value rather than implementing yet another frontend for "
"SPU. For current hardware vendors, they just need to add LLVM target "
"support instead of implementing separate Clang/C++ frontends. MLIR-HLO is"
" achieving similar goal."
