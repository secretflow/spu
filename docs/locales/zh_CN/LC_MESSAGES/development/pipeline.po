"JIT is short for `Just-in-time compilation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki"
"/Just-in-time_compilation>`_, with this approach, the compiler can get "
"more information, such as input shapes, than in `AOT mode "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation>`_. JIT may "
"introduce more evaluation overhead, but it's really trivial in secure "
"computation setting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../development/pipeline.rst:53
msgid ""
"In SPU, JIT has more benefits since the backend engine may be orders of "
"magnitude faster if it knows the *visibility* of data. For example, when "
"multiplying two secrets, the backend MPC engine may involve expensive "
"*beaver triple* progress, but when one of the inputs (of multiply) is "
"public known to all parties, the operation will be much faster. So we "
"should *mark* as much data as possible to be *public* (if it doesn't need"
" to be protected), and tell the compiler these information."

#: ../../development/pipeline.rst:55
msgid ""
"So, SPU compilation normally happens after all data infeed is done, and "
"`just in time` before the real evaluation."
