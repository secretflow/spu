" can do the encryption."
msgstr ""

#: ../../development/design_device.rst:164
msgid ""
"Third case, transfer data devices other than `P1` and `P2` to `HEU`, in "
"this case, it's neither colocated with `HEU` nor key-provider of `HEU`, "

"`HEU`, and will request `PK` from the `HEU`."

"than `key-owner node`, you have to ask key-owner node for help. This "
"depicts the fact that HE is indeed a 2PC device, so more than 2PC cases "
"should be handled specially."
