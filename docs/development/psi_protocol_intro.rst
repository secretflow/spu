PSI protocols introduction
==========================

SecretFlow SPU implements the following PSI protocols,

- Semi-honest ECDH-based two-party PSI protocol [HFH99]_
- Semi-honest ECDH-based three-party PSI protocol
- Semi-honest OT-based two-party PSI protocol [KKRT16]_
- Semi-honest OT-based two-party PSI protocol (with improved communication efficiency) [BC22]_
- Differentially Private (DP) PSI Protocol [DP-PSI]_
- Unbalanced PSI Protocol

ECDH-PSI
--------

The semi-honest DH-PSI protocol is due to Huberman, Franklin, and Hogg [HFH99]_, 
but with roots as far back as Meadows [Mea86]_. It is a semi-honest protocol that
requires exponentiations in a Diffie-Hellman group proportional to the number of items in the sets.

As a general rule, OT-based PSI protocols are (significantly) faster but require more communication 
than Diffie-Hellman-based PSI protocols. 
In some scenarios, communication cost is overwhelmingly more important than computation cost.

DH-PSI protocol based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption:

- Agree on a group G, with a generator g.
- The assumption: for random a,b,c cannot distinguish :math:`(g^a, g^b, g^{ab})` from :math:`(g^a, g^b, g^c)`

Several candidate groups are widely used, such as subgroups of the multiplication group of a finite
field and elliptic curve groups. In practice, carefully chosen elliptic curves like
Curve25519 [Ber06]_ offer a good balance between security and performance.

1. For each element :math:`x_i` in its set, Alice applies the hash function and then exponentiates it 
   using its key :math:`\alpha`, thus computing :math:`{H(x_i)}^\alpha` . Alice sends 
   :math:`\{{H(x_i)}^\alpha\}_{i=1}^{n_1}` to Bob.

2. For each element :math:`{H(x_i)}^\alpha`  received from Alice in the previous step, Bob exponentiates 
   it using its key :math:`\beta`, computing :math:`{H(x_i)}^{\alpha\beta}`. 
   Bob sends :math:`{\{{H(x_i)}^{\alpha\beta}\}}_{i=1}^{n_1}` to Alice.

3. For each element :math:`y_i` in its set, Bob applies the hash function and then exponentiates it 
   using its key :math:`\beta`, thus computing :math:`{H(y_i)}^\beta` . 
   Bob sends the set :math:`\{{H(y_i)}^\beta\}_{i=1}^{n_2}` to Alice.

4. For each element :math:`{H(y_i)}^\beta`  received from Bob in the previous step, Alice exponentiates 
   it using its key :math:`\alpha`, computing :math:`{H(y_i)}^{\beta\alpha}` .   

5. Alice compares two set :math:`{\{{H(x_i)}^{\alpha\beta}\}}_{i=1}^{n_1}` 
   and :math:`{\{{H(y_i)}^{\beta\alpha}\}}_{i=1}^{n_2}`  and gets intersection.

ECDH-PSI (3P)
-------------

We implement our own three-party PSI protocol based on ECDH. Note that our implementation has known
leakage, please use at your own risk.

Assume Alice, Bob, Chalie (receiver) want to perform 3P PSI, in addition to the final output, our 
protocol leaks the intersection size of Alice's data and Bob's data to Charlie.

.. figure:: ../imgs/dh_psi_3p.png

Note that at the beginning of ECDH-PSI protocol, we assume the input data from both Alice and Charlie are 
shuffled (It's not necessary to shuffle Bob's set).

Protocol:

1. For i-th element in its set, Alice calculates :math:`H(x_i)^\alpha` and sends to Bob.

2. For i-th element, Bob calculates :math:`H(x_i)^{\alpha\beta}` and 
   :math:`H(y_i)^\beta`, then random shuffles and sends them to Alice.

3. For i-th element, Alice calculates :math:`H(y_i)^{\alpha\beta}` and gets the intersection of 
   :math:`H(x_i)^{\alpha\beta} \cap H(y_i)^{\alpha\beta}` (we denote the intersection as 
   :math:`I^{\alpha\beta}`), then sends :math:`I^{\alpha\beta}` to Charlie.

4. For i-th element, Charlie sends :math:`H(z_i)^{\gamma}` to Bob, Bob calculates and sends to 
   Alice :math:`H(z_i)^{\beta\gamma}`, finally Alice calculates and sends to 
   Charlie :math:`H(z_i)^{\alpha\beta\gamma}`.

5. Chalie calculates :math:`I^{\alpha\beta\gamma}` and compares :math:`I^{\alpha\beta\gamma}` with
   :math:`H(z_i)^{\alpha\beta\gamma}`.

KKRT16-PSI
----------

[KKRT16]_ is semi-honest OT-based PSI, based on OT Extension, BaRK-OPRF and CuckooHash. 
[KKRT16]_ is the first PSI protocol requiring only one minute for the case of larger sets 
( :math:`2^{24}` items each) of long strings (128 bits). 

We use 3-way stash-less CuckooHash proposed in [PSZ18]_.

.. figure:: ../imgs/kkrt16_psi.png

1. Sender and Receiver Agree on CuckooHash :math:`h_1,h_2,h_3: {\{0,1\}}^{*} \rightarrow [m]`
2. Receiver insert each x into bin :math:`h_1(x)`, :math:`h_2(x)` or :math:`h_3(x)`
3. Sender insert each y into bin :math:`h_1(y)`, :math:`h_2(y)` and :math:`h_3(y)`
4. Run BaRK-OPRF, Receiver get :math:`F_{s,k_i}(x)`,Sender get :math:`F_{s,k_i}(y)`, for :math:`bin_i`
5. Sender sends all :math:`\{F_{s,k_i}(y)\}` values to Receiver
6. Receiver compare two BaRK-OPRFs set, get intersection.

 
BC22 PCG-PSI
------------

Pseudorandom Correlation Generator (PCG), is a primitive introduced in the work of Boyle et
al. [BCG+19b]_, [BCGI18]_, [SGRR19]_, [BCG+19a]_, [CIK+20]_. The goal of PCG is to compress long sources
of correlated randomness without violating security. 

Boyle et al. have designed multiple concretely efficient PCGs
for specific correlations, such as vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE) or batch oblivious linear
evaluation (BOLE). These primitives are at the heart of modern secure computation protocols with low
communication overhead.The VOLE functionality allows a receiver to learn a secret linear combination
of two vectors held by a sender and it was constructed (with sublinear communication) under variants
of the syndrome decoding assumption.

[BC22]_ use PCG speeding up private set intersection protocols, minimizing computation and communication.
We implement semi-honest version psi in [BC22]_ and use PCG/VOLE from [WYKW21]_ . [BC22]_ PSI protocol 
require only 30 seconds for the case of larger sets ( :math:`2^{24}` items each) of long strings (128 bits), 
and reduce 1/3 communication than [KKRT16]_.

.. figure:: ../imgs/pcg_psi.png

1. Sender and Receiver agree on :math:`(3,2)`-Generalized CuckooHash :math:`h_1,h_2: {\{0,1\}}^{*} \rightarrow [m]`

2. Receiver insert each x into bin :math:`h_1(x)` or :math:`h_2(x)`

3. Sender insert each y into bin :math:`h_1(y)` and :math:`h_2(y)`

4. Run PCG/VOLE from [WYKW21]_, :math:`w_i = \Delta * u_i + v_i`,  Receiver get :math:`w_i` and :math:`\Delta`, 
   Sender get :math:`u_i` and :math:`v_i`, for each :math:`bin_i`

5. Receiver sends Masked Bin Polynomial Coefficients to Sender, and receive BaRK-OPRF values

6. Sender sends all BaRK-OPRF values for each :math:`{\{y_i\}}_{i=1}^{n_2}` to Receiver

7. Receiver compares two BaRK-OPRFs sets and gets intersection.

Differentially Private PSI
--------------------------

We also implement a Differentially Private (DP) Private Set Intersection (PSI)
Protocol. Our implementaion bases on ECDH-PSI, and provides:

- Differentially private PSI results.

This feature is currently under test, please use at your own risk!  

Why PSI with differentially private results? If we want a scheme that protects
both the private inputs and output privacy, an ideal way is to use `circuit
PSI`, which is a typical PSI variant that allows secure computation (e.g. MPC or
HE) on the PSI result without revealing it. `PSTY19
<https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/241.pdf>`_ However those protocols are expensive
in terms of efficiency.  

DP-PSI is a way of utilising the up-sampling and sub-sampling mechanism to add
calibrated noises to the PSI results, without revealing its concise value.  

The protocol is listed below, assume Alice has a (hashed and shuffled) set
:math:`X` and Bob has a (hashed and shuffled) :math:`Y`.  

.. figure:: ../imgs/dp_psi.png

Note that we use encrypt to denote the process of calculating :math:`y\gets
x^a`.

Protocol:

1. Alice and Bob first encrypts their own dataset, and gets :math:`X^a` and
   :math:`Y^b` separately.
   
2. Alice sends :math:`X^a` to Bob.
   
3. Bob performs random subsampling on :math:`Y^b`, gets :math:`Y_*^b` and send
   to Alice. In the meantime, on receiving :math:`X^a` from Alice, Bob
   reencrypts it with :math:`b`, gets :math:`X^{ab}`. Then it samples a random
   permutation :math:`\pi` to permute Alice's set, and send permuted
   :math:`\pi(X^{ab})` back to Alice.
   
4. On receving :math:`Y_*^b` and :math:`\pi(X^{ab})` from Bob, Alice reencrypts
   :math:`Y_*^b` and gets :math:`Y_*^{ab}`, then calculate the intersection
   :math:`I_*^{ab}\gets\pi(X^{ab})\cap Y_*^{ab}`.
   
5. Alice randomly subsamples the intersection, gets :math:`I_{**}^{ab}`, and
   then find-out their corresponding index in :math:`Y_*^b`. Then randomly add
   non-intersection index to this set.
   
6. Alice sends the index set to Bob, then Bob reveal the final results.

In the end, this scheme ensures that the receiver (Bob) only learns the noised
intersection, without the ability of pointing out whether an element is in the
actual set intersection or not.  

Note that multiple invocation of DP-PSI inevitably weaken the privacy
protection, therefore, we strongly suggest that user should implement a
protection mechanism to prevent multiple DP-PSI executions on the same input
value.  

+---------------------------+--------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+
| Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum | 2^20   | 2^21    | 2^22    | 2^23    |   2^24    |

+---------------------------+--------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+

For DP, our default privacy protection strength is :math:`\epsilon=3`. For more
details, please refer to the original paper: [DP-PSI]_

Unbalanced PSI
--------------

Ecdh-OPRF based PSI
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

[RA18]_ section 3 introduce Basic Unbalanced PSI(Ecdh-OPRF based) protocol proposed in [BBCD+11]_ that relaxes 
the security of the [JL10]_ to be secure against semi-honest adversaries. The protocol has two phases, the preprocessing phase and the online phase. The
authors introduced many optimizations to push as much computation and communication cost to
the preprocessing phase as possible

An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between client and server for computing the 
output of a Pseudorandom Function (PRF). [draft-irtf-cfrg-voprf-10]_ specifies OPRF, VOPRF, and POPRF protocols 
built upon prime-order groups.

.. figure:: ../imgs/ecdh_oprf_psi.png

- Offline Phase
  
  1. For each element :math:`y_i` in its set, Bob applies PRF using 
     private key :math:`\beta`, i.e. computing :math:`H_2(y_i,{H_1(y_i)}^\beta)` . 
  
  2. Bob sends :math:`\{{H_2(y_i,{H_1(y_i)}^\beta)}\}_{i=1}^{n_2}` to Alice in shuffled order
   
- Online Phase
  
  1. For each element :math:`x_i` in its set, Alice applies the hash function and then exponentiates 
     it using its blind key :math:`r_i`, thus computing :math:`{H_1(x_i)}^{r_i}`. Alice sends 
     :math:`\{{H_1(x_i)}^{r_i}\}_{i=1}^{n_1}` to Bob.
  2. For each element :math:`H_1(x_i)^{r_i}` received from Alice in the previous step, Bob exponentiates 
     it using its key :math:`\beta`, computing :math:`{H_1(x_i)}^{r_i\beta}`. 
     Bob sends :math:`{\{{H_1(x_i)}^{{r_i}\beta}\}}_{i=1}^{n_1}` to Alice.
  3. Alice receive :math:`{\{{H_1(x_i)}^{r_i\beta}\}}_{i=1}^{n_1}` from Bob, and unblind it use :math:`r_i`,
     Get :math:`\{{{H_1(x_i)}^\beta}\}_{i=1}^{n_1}`, compute OPRF :math:`\{{H_2(x_i,{H_1(x_i)}^\beta)}\}_{i=1}^{n_1}`.
  4. Alice compares two sets :math:`\{{H_2(x_i,{H_1(x_i)}^\beta)}\}_{i=1}^{n_1}`
     and :math:`\{{H_2(y_i,{H_1(y_i)}^\beta)}\}_{i=1}^{n_2}` and gets intersection.

Labeled PSI
>>>>>>>>>>>

Somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) can be used to build efficient (labeled) Private Set Intersection 
protocols in the unbalanced setting, where one of the sets is much larger than the other. 
[CMGD+21]_ introduce several optimizations and improvements to the protocols of 
[CLR17]_, [CHLR18]_ that result in improved running time and improved communication complexity in the 
sender's set size.

Microsoft `APSI (Asymmetric PSI) <https://github.com/microsoft/APSI>`_  library provide a PSI functionality 
for asymmetric set sizes based on the latest [CMGD+21]_.  APSI uses the BFV([FV12]_) encryption scheme implemented 
in the Microsoft [SEAL]_ library.

SecretFlow SPU wrap `APSI <https://github.com/microsoft/APSI>`_ library, can be used for 

- Unbalanced PSI
- Malicious PSI
- Labeled PSI
- Keyword PIR

.. figure:: ../imgs/labeled_psi.png

- Setup Phase
  
  1. **Choose ItemParams**, TableParams, QueryParams, SEALParams.
  2. **Sender's OPRF**: The sender samples a key :math:`\beta` for the OPRF, update its items set 
     to :math:`\{{H_2(s_i,{H_1(s_i)}^\beta)}\}_{s_i\in S}`.
  3. **Sender's Hashing**: Sender inserts all :math:`s_i\in S` into the sets :math:`\mathcal{B}[h_0(s_i)]`,
     :math:`\mathcal{B}[h_1(s_i)]` and :math:`\mathcal{B}[h_2(s_i)]`.
  4. **Splitting**: For each set :math:`\mathcal{B}[i]`, the sender splits it into bin bundles, denoted as
     :math:`\mathcal{B}[i,1]`, ..., :math:`\mathcal{B}[i,k]`.
  5. **Computing Coeffcients**: 
   
     - **Matching Polynomial**: For each bin bundle :math:`\mathcal{B}[i,j]`, the sender computes the 
       matching polynomial over :math:`\mathbb{F}_t`.
     - **Label Polynomial**: If the sender has labels associated with its set, then for each bin bundle 
       :math:`\mathcal{B}[i,j]`, the sender interpolates the label polynomial over :math:`\mathbb{F}_t`.
   
- Intersection Phase
  
  1. Receiver Encrypt :math:`r_i \in R`.

     - **Receiver's OPRF**: Receiver and Sender run ecdh-OPRF protocol, get 
       :math:`\{{H_2(r_i,{H_1(r_i)}^\beta)}\}_{r_i\in R}`.
     - **Receiver's CuckooHash**: Receiver performs cuckoo hashing on the set :math:`R` into CuckooTable C with m bins
       using h1; h2; h3 has the hash functions.
     - **Packing**: Receiver pack items in CuckooTable C into a FHE plaintext polynomial.
     - **Windowsing**: the receiver computes the component-wise query powers.
     - **Encrypt**: The receiver uses *FHE.Encrypt* to encrypt query powers and sends the ciphertexts to the sender.

  2. **Sender Homomorphically evaluate Matching Polynomial**: The sender receives the collection of
     ciphertexts homomorphically evaluates Matching Polynomial. If Labeled PSI is desired, Sender homomorphically evaluates 
     Label Polynomial. The sender send evaluated ciphertexts to Receiver.
  3. **Receiver Decrypt and Get result**: receiver receives and decrypts the matching ciphertexts, and label 
     ciphertexts if needed. output the matching set and labels.
