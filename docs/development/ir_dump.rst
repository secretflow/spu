Dump IR to DAG
========================

.. warning::
    The configuration for dump IR to DAG maybe unstable. Please refer to the :spu_code_host:`spu.proto </spu/blob/main/libspu/spu.proto>` for latest configurations.

Introduction
------------
This document provides the demo for how to dump the IR (Intermediate Representation, generated by `XLA <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/architecture>`_) to a DAG. 
With the aid of visualized DAG, the execution logic and required operators will be more explicit.


.. Note::
    Please refer to :ref:`/development/compiler.rst` for description of the role of XLA in SPU.


TL;DR
------------
In case you just want to have a try on obtaining the DAG for executed code, we provide a :spu_code_host:`demo </spu/blob/main/examples/python/ir_dump/ir_dump.py>` that demonstrates the required code modifications to enable dumping the IR of executed code to a custom path.

For those users who have designated requirements (e.g., dump to txt, dot, html), we recommend to read the following detailed step-by-step elaborations.


Configuration
-------------
Please first have a look at the :spu_code_host:`spu.proto </spu/blob/main/libspu/spu.proto>` for SPU. To dump the IR, we should modify the compiler options, which is shown in the following code snippet.

.. code-block:: protobuf
    :caption: Compiler Options

    message CompilerOptions {
        // Pretty print
        bool enable_pretty_print = 1;
        string pretty_print_dump_dir = 2;
        XLAPrettyPrintKind xla_pp_kind = 3;
        
        // Disable sqrt(x) + eps to sqrt(x+eps) rewrite
        bool disable_sqrt_plus_epsilon_rewrite = 10;

        // Disable x/sqrt(y) to x*rsqrt(y) rewrite
        bool disable_div_sqrt_rewrite = 11;

        // Disable reduce truncation optimization
        bool disable_reduce_truncation_optimization = 12;

        // Disable maxpooling optimization
        bool disable_maxpooling_optimization = 13;

        // Disallow mix type operations
        bool disallow_mix_types_opts = 14;

        // Disable SelectOp optimization
        bool disable_select_optimization = 15;

        // Enable optimize x/bcast(y) -> x * bcast(1/y)
        bool enable_optimize_denominator_with_broadcast = 16;
    }

The part of the above code related to dumping IR to DAG is as follows.

.. code-block:: protobuf
    :caption: Configurations related to dump IR

    // Pretty print
    bool enable_pretty_print = 1;
    string pretty_print_dump_dir = 2;
    XLAPrettyPrintKind xla_pp_kind = 3;  

In general, we require to focus on three variables to control the dump behavior.

- **enable_pretty_print** is a *bool* value, which denotes whether to dump the IR or not.
- **pretty_print_dump_dir** is a *string* value, which denotes the dump path (should be a directory).
- **xla_pp_kind** is a *int* value, of which the range is [0, 1, 2], with each one representing one dump format. To date, we support three kinds of formats: TEXT, DOT and HTML. If you want to obtain the DAG, you should use DOT or HTML.

.. Note::
    For **DOT** files, you should use `GraphViz <https://graphviz.org/>`_ to convert them to PDF or PNG to visualize the DAG. 
    
    While for **HTML** files, you can directly open the them in your Web Browser, which shall render the DAG.

.. code-block:: protobuf
    :caption: XLA Pretty Print Kind

    enum XLAPrettyPrintKind {
        TEXT = 0;
        DOT = 1;
        HTML = 2;
    }


Pass custom compiler options
----------------------------------------
We hereby describe how to manually pass the custom compiler options to dump the IR of executed code.

First of all, we declare an CompilerOptions object. Note that the **pretty_print_dump_dir** is better to be an absolute path.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Declare CompilerOptions object

    import spu.spu_pb2 as spu_pb2
    copts = spu_pb2.CompilerOptions()
    copts.enable_pretty_print = True
    copts.pretty_print_dump_dir = "your/custom/path"
    copts.xla_pp_kind = 2

Then we pass the CompilerOptions to the executed SPU code.


The code shall be modified from 

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: SPU execution without customized compiler options

    res_spu = ppd.device("SPU")(func)(x_spu, y_spu)

to

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: SPU execution with customized compiler options

    res_spu = ppd.device("SPU")(func, copts=copts)(x_spu, y_spu)

.. Note::
    Here, `func` is a Python function. Please refer to the :spu_code_host:`demo </spu/blob/main/examples/python/ir_dump/ir_dump.py>` for the context.

In the end, you can just run the target code and the output (e.g., DOT) can be found in **your custom path**.

Example
-------
We here provide the code snippet for dumping IR to HTML files. The DAG for the executed function is illustrated in the end.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Code snippet for dumping the IR of func

    def func(x, y):
        """
        Any custom function that consists of operators that SPU currently supports.
        Here, we define a `max` function use jax.numpy.
        """
        return jnp.maximum(x, y)
    
    def get_data(seed=123):
        """
        Any IO function that loads the data.
        """
        np.random.seed(seed)
        data = np.random.randn(3, 4)
        return data
    
    x = get_data(1)
    y = get_data(2)

    # SPU secure version
    x_spu = ppd.device("P1")(lambda x: x)(x)
    y_spu = ppd.device("P2")(lambda x: x)(y)

    import spu.spu_pb2 as spu_pb2
    copts = spu_pb2.CompilerOptions()
    copts.enable_pretty_print = True
    copts.pretty_print_dump_dir = "dump/path"
    copts.xla_pp_kind = 2 # HTML format

    res_spu = ppd.device("SPU")(func, copts=copts)(x_spu, y_spu)

.. Note::
    You may find multiple files in the output directory since XLA has mutliple compile passes and generates multiple IRs, with each corresponding to one DAG.


The **HTML** output is rendered as follows.
