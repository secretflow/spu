# SPU: Secure Processing Unit

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/secretflow/spu/tree/beta.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/secretflow/spu/tree/beta)

SPU (Secure Processing Unit) aims to be a `provable`, `measurable` secure computation device, which provides computation ability while keeping your private data protected.

SPU could be treated as a programmable device, it's not designed to be used directly. Normally we use SecretFlow framework, which use SPU as the underline secure computing device.

Currently, we mainly focus on `provable` security. It contains a secure runtime that evaluates [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/operation_semantics)-like tensor operations, which use [MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) as the underline evaluation engine to protect privacy information.

SPU python package also contains a simple distributed module to demo SPU usage, but it's **NOT designed for production** due to system security and performance concerns, please **DO NOT** use it directly in production.
