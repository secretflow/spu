SPU (Secure Processing Unit) aims to be a `provable`, `measurable` secure computation device,
which provides computation ability while keeping your private data protected.

SPU could be treated as a programmable device, it's not designed to be used directly.
Normally we use SecretFlow framework, which use SPU as the underline secure computing device.

Currently, we mainly focus on `provable` security. It contains a secure runtime that evaluates
[XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/operation_semantics)-like tensor operations,
which use [MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) as the underline
evaluation engine to protect privacy information.

SPU python package also contains a simple distributed module to demo SPU usage,
but it's **NOT designed for production** due to system security and performance concerns,
please **DO NOT** use it directly in production.

  abstract = 	 {Due to the rising privacy concerns on sensitive client data and trained models like Transformers, secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques are employed to enable secure inference despite attendant overhead. Existing works attempt to reduce the overhead using more MPC-friendly non-linear function approximations. However, the integration of quantization widely used in plaintext inference into the MPC domain remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we propose the framework named Ditto to enable more efficient quantization-aware secure Transformer inference. Concretely, we first incorporate an MPC-friendly quantization into Transformer inference and employ a quantization-aware distillation procedure to maintain the model utility. Then, we propose novel MPC primitives to support the type conversions that are essential in quantization and implement the quantization-aware MPC execution of secure quantized inference. This approach significantly decreases both computation and communication overhead, leading to improvements in overall efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on Bert and GPT2 models to evaluate the performance of Ditto. The results demonstrate that Ditto is about $3.14\sim 4.40\times$ faster than MPCFormer (ICLR 2023) and $1.44\sim 2.35\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art work PUMA with negligible utility degradation.}
